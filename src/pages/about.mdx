## Vision

Our center's vision is to bring the power of Scalable Computing and Data-Driven Discovery to several domain sciences
and create a collaborative research environment that is intended to be recognized in the city of Chicago, the state
of Illinois, and nation-wide for its excellence and forward-thinking agenda.

## Mission

As the data volume, variety, velocity and veracity increases it becomes extremely difficult to perform efficient and
meaningful computations. The availability of data, advances in modern data science and scalable computing technologies
has now made it possible to use data-driven techniques in scientific discovery. Our mission is to empower research in
the intersection of Scalable Computing and Data-Driven Discovery. Through its cutting-edge research, our center aims to
develop, extend, and release advanced solutions for high-performance computational capabilities and bridge the gap
between Scalable Computing and Data-Driven Discovery.

Particularly, we identify the following three objectives:

- Capture the demand for expertise in Scalable Computing technologies such as parallelization, advanced data management,
  and distributed storage solutions.
- Develop and extend cutting-edge tools, frameworks, and solutions for domains that employ Data-Driven computations
  (e.g., time-series datasets and predictive analytics).
- Be the conduit between data scientists and computer system architects to co-design and co-develop the next-generation
  of data products and cyberinfrastructure.
