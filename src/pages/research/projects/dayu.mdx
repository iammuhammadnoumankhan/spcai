# DaYu: Optimizing Workflow Performance by Elucidating Semantic Data Flow

<ProjectBadges projectId="dayu" />

Distributed scientific workflows nowadays face challenges in data movement through storage systems. 
DaYu employs careful runtime measurement, maps domain semantics to low-level I/O operations, and utilizes 
effective visualization and analysis of semantic data flows to understand how semantic datasets move through storage.

## Introduction

High-Performance Computing (HPC) workflows are evolving with increasing data intensity. 
These workflows are growing in complexity, featuring multiple stages encompassing simulation, analysis, 
and AI applications with diverse data demands. 
Data transfer between HPC tasks currently relies on shared storage layers like Parallel File System (PFS) 
and Burst Buffer, which can suffer from slow access and I/O contention.

Enhancing data movement within workflows poses a significant challenge. 
Strategic task scheduling, data caching, and staging have emerged as 
effective means to boost I/O performance by reducing computation wait times. 
With more I/O expertise, one can also utilize and fine-tune various I/O
libraries, middleware, and file system configurations. The tuning often 
requires iterative testing and are limited to specific workload, whille other 
workloads still experiencing high latency with shared storage.

Understanding I/O behavior is imperative when deciding on the correct strategies to enhance data access. 
Details about data access within workflow tasks can effectively guide improvements in I/O and system configuration. 
Existing application I/O profiling tools lack the ability to provide analyze of data access behavior across 
tasks in a workflow and capture semantic
information related to its low-level I/O requests. Such tools would
be valuable for providing more straightforward insights into
data access patterns across multiple tasks. By filling this gap, we
can develop better methods for managing data movement and
optimizing the overall workflow.

**In this work, we unveil a fresh workflow optimization perspective with**
- careful runtime measurement of data access metrics,
- recovering the mapping of domain semantics to low-level I/O operations, and
- effective visualization and analysis of semantic data flows for the complete workflow.

**HDF5 File Structure Overview**

HDF5 is a widely used storage format and I/O libraries in scientific applications

- Hierarchical structure of groups, datasets, and attributes
- Allows enriched metadata that describes different data characteristics
- Extensive API enabling tracking of its high-level data object and the low-level I/O



## Approach
The project's major challenges include mapping data semantics to I/O access, 
tracking data flow across tasks, and visualizing coordination and time. 
Our approach consists of three steps:

## Case Study I: Storm Tracking Workflow
**PyFLEXTRKR** uses a flexible atmospheric feature tracking software package 
for weather research and forecast datasets.

</p>

**Six-Stages Pipeline PyFLEXTRKR Workflow.**
</center>



**Observations**
- **Inter-task Data Reuse**: task 2, 4, and 6 uses files produced by the first task.
- **Time-dependents inputs**: some input files are required at different time point.
- **Data None-Used**: file produced by task 4 is not used by any later task.

**Opportunities**
- Tasks that use common datasets can be scheduled on the same resource.
- Input can be stage-in at different time points of the workflow.
- not used by later tasks can be immediately offloaded to free up memory.


## Case Study II: DeepDriveMD Workflow
**DeepDriveMD** (DDMD) is a deep learning-driven molecular dynamics 
simulations workflow for protein folding.

### Workflow Task-File DAG

</p>

**Four-Stages Pipeline Workflow (simulation, aggregate, train, and inference).**
</center>

**Observation**: No data dependencies between `Train` and `Inference` tasks, 
as we can see that both of them reads input aggregated.h5, and output different 
sets of files that are not used by each other.

**Opportunity**: `Inference` and `Train` tasks can be parallelized 
without violating data dependency correctness. 

### Semantic DAG 1

</p>

**Aggregate Stage Close-Up Semantic DAG with Two Datasets.**
</center>


**Observation**: The `Aggregate` task alters the data layout of large datasets without changing the content. 
Over 95% of the data volume is from the `contact_map` dataset, while only small amount is from the
`point_cloud` dataset.

**Opportunity**: Removing the `Aggregate` task does not compromise the correctness of the program. 
We have `Train` and `Inference` task reading input directly from simulation, this can reduce unnecessary
data manipulation and movement and improve data access parallelism.

### Semantic DAG 2

<center>

  <img src={require("@site/static/img/projects/dayu/DDMD_train_dset.png").default} width="800" />
</p>

**DDMD Train Stage Read File I/O Performance Detail.**
</center>


**Observation**: The `Train` task is not accessing all the datasets present in the `aggregated.h5` file. 
In fact, it is not using the largest datasets which takes up 95% of the file space (from previous observation).

**Opportunities**
- Removing the `Aggregate` task can minimize unnecessary data transfers.
- Caching a subset of the `aggregated.h5` file does not violate task-data dependencies.

## Conclusion

Nowadays in HPC applications, there is a lack of tools to understand 
data flow between tasks in a workflow. This study introduced Semantic DAGs, 
an enriched version of traditional DAGs. Precise measurements allowed us 
to reconstruct mappings between tasks and meaningful data objects down to 
I/O with file addresses. With visualization of task-to-data mapping and 
extracted performance statistics, we can gain new insight into workflow 
optimization opportunities.

Our future work will focus on enhancing the analysis method and creating 
a generalized approach for customized data placement in workflows. 
We aim to achieve this through I/O buffering middleware and apply our 
analysis for effective I/O system tuning to meet workload requirements.
