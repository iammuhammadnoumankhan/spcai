# LABIOS: A Distributed Label-Based I/O System

<ProjectBadges projectId="labios" />

## Introduction

**HPC and Big Data** environments have **diverged** over the years,
resulting in diverging and even **conflicting I/O requirements**.

- **Consistency**: Strong vs. Eventual
- **File Access**: Shared vs. Independent
- **Namespace**: Hierarchical vs. Flat
- **Hardware**: Specialized vs. Commodity

Addressing these challenges is vital to **HPC + Big Data Convergence**,
as it **enables colocating conflicting I/O workloads** on the same
cluster without sacrificing performance through **storage bridging**;
**resource heterogeneity** and **data provisioning** to support
transparent data operations and conversions for complex hyperconverged
workloads; **storage malleability** to improve resource utilization and
job throughput in multi-tenant scenarios.

## Approach
- **Data Model**
    - **Labels**, tuple of multiple operations & a pointer to input
    data
    - **Storage-independent expression** of application's intent
- **Label Manager**
    - **Build** multiple labels based on the request characteristics
    - Splits or combines labels to **optimal I/O** sizes

- **Content Manager**
    - Data labels are **temporarily stored** here for async data
    placement and computations
    - Represented as a **key-value store**
- **Label Dispatcher**
    - **Dispatches** labels to workers
    - Supports various **scheduling policies**
    - **Reorder labels** while considering consistency
## Use Cases

<p>
  <img src={require("@site/static/img/projects/labios/as_I_O_accelerator.png").default}  alt="Labios deployed for IO Accelerator" width="600" />
</p>

- Labios for I/O acceleration
    - Fast distributed cache for temporary I/O
    - Ideal for Hadoop workloads with node-local I/O

<p>
  <img src={require("@site/static/img/projects/labios/as_I_O_fwl.png").default}  alt="Labios deployed for IO forwarding" width="600" />
</p>

- Labios for I/O forwarding
    - Ideal for asynchronous I/O
    - Apps pass data to Labios
    - Labios interacts with remote storage
    - Scalability limited to the size of I/O forwarding layer

<p>
  <img src={require("@site/static/img/projects/labios/as_I_O_buffer.png").default}  alt="Labios deployed for IO buffering" width="600" />
</p>

- Labios for I/O buffering
    - Fast temporary storage for persistent I/O
    - Data sharing between programs
    - In-situ visualization and analysis
    - Deep learning training pipelines

<p>
  <img src={require("@site/static/img/projects/labios/as_Storage.png").default}  alt="Labios deployed for remote storage" width="600" />
</p>

- Labios as remote storage
    - Fast permanent storage
    - Transparently support storage hierarchies
    - Improved resource utilization and energy due to storage malleability
    - Opportunities for live reconfiguration, crash-restart, and code upgrades

## Key Takeaways!
Labios allows for **Data-centric system design** with up to **6x boost** in I/O performance and **65% reduction** in execution time. This data-centric system approach can allow a more **profound understanding** of how data flows into the system, allowing for **AI-driven I/O optimizations** and **data interoperability**.
