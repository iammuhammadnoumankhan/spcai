# Coeus: Accelerating Scientific Insights Using Enriched Metadata

<ProjectBadges projectId="coeus" />

In collaboration with Sandia and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, coeus investigate the use of an active storage system
to calculate derived quantities and support complex queries on scientific data (simulation and observational) as well
as optimizing data placement across the storage hierarchy, with awareness of the resource limitations, to better support
the scientific discovery process.
